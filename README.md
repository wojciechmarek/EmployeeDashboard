# Modern Dashboard

It is a modern dashboard for modern companies.

## Purpose

To learn the Angular 15 and NestJS frameworks and build a modern application with cutting-edge technologies:

- using the latest Angular 15 features (standalone components, Signals, etc.),
- using the latest NestJS features (GraphQL, etc.),
- using the docker containers to develop and run the application,
- using real-time communication with GraphQL subscriptions,
- using Nx to manage the mono repo (to share code between the front end and the backend).

## How to run

There are two ways to start a project:

- using a classic Node.js environment installed on the local machine,
- using a development container (the `devcontainer.json` file in the repo).

The classic way:

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
3. Clone the repository.
4. Type and run: `yarn` in the root directory.
5. Type and run: `yarn dev` in the root directory.
6. Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to see the frontend app.
7. Open `http://localhost:3333` in your browser to see the backend app.
